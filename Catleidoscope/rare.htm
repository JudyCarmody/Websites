					<td>Burmese Cats<br>
						Regarded as one of the most intelligent cats out there, Burmese cats are also known to be fairly dog-like, with a propensity to greet their people at the door the way a devoted puppy might. Also like dogs, Burmese cats crave human attention, and should not be left alone for long periods of time.</td>

					<th><a href="images\brshorthair.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\brshorthair.jpg" alt="British Shorthair"></a></th>
					<td>British Shorthair<br>
						 Affectionate without being clingy and enjoys curling up beside you rather than being a lap cat. The Brit is a healthy, hardy feline that matures slowly in three to five years. Playful, alert and intelligent, this cat loves children. Though reserved with strangers, this breed quickly warms up when love is given in return. The British Shorthair is compact, well-balanced and powerful, with a short, dense, plush coat. </td>

					<th><a href="images\egyptmau.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\egyptmau.jpg" alt="Egyptian Mau"></a></th>
					<td>Egyptian Mau<br>
						Statuesque breed with a muscular, vividly spotted coat and gooseberry green eyes. The Mau, the Egyptian word for cat, is highly intelligent. She adores toys and will stalk anything that moves. A loyal, constant companion, this feline prefers being the only pet in a household as she does not readily adapt to other cats or dogs. </td>

					<th><a href="images\cornishrex.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\cornishrex.jpg" alt="Cornish Rex"></a></th>
					<td>Cornish Rex<br>
						Bat-eared, big-eyed and wavy-coated, the Cornish Rex has a distinctive look and exceptionally silky coat due to not having guard hairs like other breeds. This active cat has a small, whippetlike body and loves to climb, leap and sprint. With kittenlike antics that last a lifetime, this feline likes to be where the action is. The Cornish Rex is perfect for those who want a cat to participate in their family life. </td>

				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\singapura.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\singapura.jpg" alt="Singapura"></a></th>
					<td>Singapura<br>
						The smallest domestic cat breed, the Singapura is an extroverted, playful feline sometimes called a “pesky people cat.” This breed thrives on attention and interactive play. Called Pura for short, these cats are intelligent and keenly observant. Friendly and social, they enjoy cats and cat friendly dogs, but dislike loud noises so are not ideal for busy households with boisterous children. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\sphynx.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\sphynx.jpg" alt="Sphynx"></a></th>
					<td>Sphynx<br>
						The hairless Sphynx is muscular with broad ears and a wide-eyed, friendly expression. This sweet-natured, lively cat is inquisitive and loves being the center of attention. A devoted, affectionate feline, the Sphynx follows her human companions everywhere, purring with delight. This breed does not do well when left alone all day. The Sphynx is a healthy, hardy cat.</td>
