				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\shorthair.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\shorthair.jpg" alt="Domestic Shorthair"></a></th>
					<td>Domestic Shorthair and Domestic Longhair Cats<br>
						Otherwise known as "that cat" (or your standard alley cat) domestics are not an officially recognized or pedigreed breed. Then again, most modern cat breeds are descendents of one type of domestic or another, and 95% of house cats in the US are Domestics. Domestics come in all colors and sizes, and may have long or short of hair.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\persian.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\persian.jpg" alt="Persian"></a></th>
					<td>Persian Cats<br>
						Despite the need for daily brushing, Persians are a household favorite. Persian cats are known to be calm and somewhat sensitive. As such, gentle environments are recommended for Persians.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\mainecoon.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\mainecoon.jpg" alt="Maine Coon"></a></th>
					<td>Maine Coon Cats<br>
						Large and playful, but gentle and intelligent, Maine Coons are great with both children and dogs. Popular on farms, Maine Coons tend to follow their people around both inside and outdoors.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\siamese.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\siamese.jpg" alt="Siamese"></a></th>
					<td>Siamese Cats<br>
						Popular among those who desire a pedigreed pet, the Siamese is as vocal as they are playful. Known to be frisky and full of energy, Siamese cats are a popular household choice.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\amshorthair.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\amshorthair.jpg" alt="American Shorthair"></a></th>
					<td>American Shorthair<br>
						Descended from European forebears, as are many of their human counterparts, the American Shorthair is a very low-maintenance cat. Personalities can vary from cat to cat, but overall American Shorthairs are quiet cats.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\exshorthair.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\exshorthair.jpg" alt="Exotic Shorthair"></a></th>
					<td>Exotic Shorthair<br>
						The Exotic Shorthair resembles the Persian in just about every way. Except one -- their hair is shorter and denser. Thus, their coat requires far less maintenance. Exotic Shorthair cats do require brushing at least weekly, or better twice weekly, which is still far less than the Persianâ€™s recommended every-day brushing.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\ragdollr.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\ragdoll.jpg" alt="Ragdoll"></a></th>
					<td>Ragdoll<br>
						So named because they tend to go limp when you pick them up, Ragdolls are the quintessential lap-cat. Ragdoll cats tend to grow quite large. They can weigh upwards of 20 lbs, and sometimes males weigh more.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th><a href="images\himalayan.jpg" class="nobg"><img class="resize3" src="images\himalayan.jpg" alt="Himalayan"></a></th>
					<td>Himalayan<br>
						Like Persians, Himalayan cats have long silky fur which requires daily human intervention to prevent matting. Himalayan cats may have short smushed-in faces (like the Pug dog breed), or they may have a slightly longer and more traditional-looking face. Himalayans are descended from Siamese, and so are outgoing, active, and sociable companions.</td>
