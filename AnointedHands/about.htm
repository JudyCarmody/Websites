		<p>I worship God. God is my everything and He provides for me! 
		I attend church every week, and I am a very devout Christian woman.<br/></br/>
		
		I have been sewing for 30 years. I live in Euless, TX, near DFW Airport, in the Dallas-Fort Worth, TX area.<br/><br/>
		
		Originally, I am from Brooklyn, NY. Born and raised. I have a part-time job as a custodian, but sewing is my passion.<br/><br/>
		
		My favorite music is Gospel with Oldies a very close second.<br/><br/>
