		<p id="warning">A coworker inspired me to make this website. She is a Christian&#169;&#174;&#8482; , and keeps talking out her sewing business and how she will leave her current job when(if) she gets more sewing supplies.<br/><br/>
		I created this website to refresh my HTML and CSS skills. This is not a functional shop, if you use the order form, you will not receive any response. The order form is for show and to test out the PHP script.</p>
		
		Welcome to my website! I make clothes of all sorts from choir robes, pastor robes, to blouses, 2 and 3 piece suits, and even dress pants and uniforms.
