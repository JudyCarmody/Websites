# Websites
Some websites I created for fun.

## AnointedHands
A website I created to brush up on my HTML and CSS knowledge. It was inspired by a coworker.

## Catleidoscope
This was created for a course I took.

## UTPBBioClub
I created this for the Biology Club at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin. They didn't use it.
